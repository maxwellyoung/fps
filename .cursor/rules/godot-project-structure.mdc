# Godot Project Structure

This is a Godot Engine project.

*   The main project definition is in [project.godot](mdc:project.godot).
*   Game scenes, which compose levels and objects, are stored in `.tscn` files like [level.tscn](mdc:level.tscn) and [player.tscn](mdc:player.tscn).
*   Game logic is written in GDScript (`.gd` files), such as [player.gd](mdc:player.gd).
