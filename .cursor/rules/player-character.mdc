# Player Character

The player character is implemented in [player.gd](mdc:player.gd) and its corresponding scene is [player.tscn](mdc:player.tscn).

The script [player.gd](mdc:player.gd) handles:
*   Player movement (FPS-style controls with walking and sprinting).
*   Jumping and gravity.
*   Mouse look (camera control).
*   Health and damage system via `take_damage(amount)`. It emits a `health_changed` signal.
*   Ammo system. It emits an `ammo_changed` signal.
*   Shooting mechanics using a RayCast, with muzzle flash, gunshot sounds, and impact effects.
