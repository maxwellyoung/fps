# Player Character

The player character is implemented in [player.gd](mdc:player.gd) and its corresponding scene is [player.tscn](mdc:player.tscn).

The script [player.gd](mdc:player.gd) handles:
*   Player movement (FPS-style controls).
*   Mouse look (camera control).
*   Shooting mechanics using a RayCast.
